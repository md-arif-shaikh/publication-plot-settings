* About
  Settings for publication quality plots using matplotlib. The goal
  here is to get plots consistent with high quality journals.

  To make sure that we do the following
  - Save the fig at the actual figure size that would be put in the
    paper. This would make sure that the fonts and labels are visible
    and has correct sizes. This would imply that we do not scale the
    figure in the TeX document. The figure size could in principle vary with
    journals and the scope of use.
  - Use a linestyle cycler which would plot different lines
    with different styles to make sure that they are dintinguished
    easily.
  - Use a color cycle with nice colors.
  - Use appropriate spaces around the plot inside the figure such that
    no spaces are wasted.
